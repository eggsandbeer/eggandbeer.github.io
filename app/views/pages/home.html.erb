                            <p>This is a heavily javascript dependent site. While I wasn't responsible for developing the name spacing, broad over-arching structure for this site (if I had been, I would've recommended using Backbone.js), I handled majority of the ajax requests used to pull in user data when moving from page to page and when changing data on the site (there are COUNTLESS ways to change data on this site). Hover effects, drop downs, accordians, slide-show caraousels, form submissions, image magnification on hover and so much more -- this site has all the typicall cool, hover-in, hoverup, etc, etc effects -- were all handled by me (and the team) too, whether by implementing plug-ins or hand coding stuff from scratch.</p>
                            
                            <p>This was without a doubt the biggest project I've ever worked on. We used twitter's bootstrap templating on major parts of the site. We also used LESS and did some smart but obvious (now) things like developing mix-ins for gradients and storing colours in variables. Fun, intense and 100% good for honing my javascript skills.</p>

                            <p>This is the biggest project I've ever worked on. Built at the core with Python and Django, the KCT Celebration tour website has a host of complicated features that I helped to build with javascript, jQuery, ajax, LESS and Django.</p>

                            <p>The javascript included a lot of stuff written from scratch. I built out front end logic on things like a character counter for the page to insert their 'story' during the nomination process, a Ajax powered form (complete with a recaptcha checker) for submitting votes without reloading the page, a google maps powered location pin pointer and a whole bunch of other smaller apps.</p>

                            <p>This was another site where I learned the importance of details and communication. This site went through many, many changes and required a lot of back and forth with management to try and figure out what was right and what was wrong. Again, communication and lots and lots of questions was important.</p>
                            
                            <p>Primarily, I built out the HTML and CSS for a lot of the secondary pages on this site (the newsroom page, the about us page, the contact us page, etc.) As well, I did a lot of the CSS/LESS (acceptable down to ie7) on the front page search form box and then, generally, killed off javascript, CSS, HTML tickets as they arose.</p>

                            <p>Because this site has to work all the way down to internet explorer, there was a lot of very careful checking of the LESS/CSS on this site. We used LESS variables to build some of the gradients here and making sure our mix-ins worked all the way down.</p>

                            <p>This was the first project that I worked on at Trapeze Media, a Toronto based design and digital advertising firm. This sampling app, is actually no longer available on the web, but its CSS/HTML is now used accross the facebook site for Thinsations.</p>

                            <p>This site was also the first time I ever used Django. So the concept of stacking 'includes' and double brackets and question mark brackets and everything else that django offers was all totally new to me.</p>

                            <p>This project really taught me the importance of being extremely careful with my project management. I had to check a deck for the correct copy to be used and I had to make sure it was translated properly. I had to make sure that every colon, semi-colon and dash was in the proper place. It wasn't as easy as just copy and pasting from the word document either. There were multiple copy decks, each with different copy for the same section. The important part was noticing the difference in the first place and then checking up on what was the right thing to do. Not exactly diffcult, but certainly required a careful eye.</p>

                            <p>PWS Consulting is a consulting service in geophysics and business management that needed to establish themselves on the web. I designed PWSâ€™s website and branding on my own from the ground up and gave them an identity that matches their personality: pragmatic, solid and grounded.</p>

                            <p>The main thing I learned with this project is how important it is it design a site that is full compatible with Wordpress and all it's content management options. It's so much much easier to hard code titles, paragraphs, content in general (like I did on THIS site), but if you do that, then why even bother using Wordpress in the first place (I didn't both on this site)? So, I really had to think about how to make the site Wordpress and user friendly.</p>

                            <p>Langara is where I started to get really serious about web development as a career and where I learned javascript/jQuery. What a constructor is, what the global name space is, what prototypical inheritance is, and then, WAY more basically, how to even load up a script in the head tag -- at Langara, I got of that knowledge.</p>

                            <p>At the same time, in school, you have a lot more freedom to experiment with weird code things, so I did that. I messed around with some webGl and with Google's WebGL Globe project and made my own font on fontstruct.com and a whole bunch of other things. These projects all used to be live on the web but I lost their domains, but, hopefully, these pictures will give you some idea of what I'm up to on the web.</p>

                            <p>The site used Wordpress for the CMS and had a bunch of cool css effects on things like hovering overlinks and border-images. However, I has to use a lot of jquery plug-ins for sliders and other not-from-scartch code to make the site function. So, I decided to scrap the site and build the one you are currently looking at from the ground up to really, really show off my nifty code skillz.</p>

This old theme was built from the ground up for WordPress and has a kind of old Wild West feel to thanks to some of my photography from an Arizona trip. It's the first non-static site I built and introduced me to cool ideas like header.php, footer.php and the Wordpress Lopp</p>

                            <p>This also is the first serious theme that I developed for Wordpress, though I've been using Wordpress for years. I took the Starkers root template theme and basically just stared at the damn thing until the php and Wordpress functions all started to make sense. It took some time (way too many bleary eyed nights up past 2 a.m.) and a lot of luck, but hey, everyone has to start somewhere.</p>
