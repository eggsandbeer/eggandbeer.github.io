The project is supposed to be responsive and to a large extend it is, but a site that is supposed to adapt to fit ANY size device is pretty tricky to accomplish and you can see some of the seems showing on some pages. Still, I'm proud of this site, and it certainly walked me through the basics and more advanced sides of MVC frameworks like Backbone.",

I used the google globe project to display a dataset. I built my own font using fontstruct's site and I launched a number of small sites for displaying my work. I had a rudementary degree of knowledge about web basics before Langara. After Langara, my foundational knowledge was stronger. The difference between position absolute and relative. What a script tag is. What a variable is. Em vs rems vs px (though not how to use them properly). It was these basic things that I honed while at Langara.",
