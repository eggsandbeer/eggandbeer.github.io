I fixed numerous bugs, built things like email subscription pop up modals and maintained the numerous gulp tasks that went along with the project. Timeline also had a big CMS, built with angular 1 and a host of plugins/directives from the angular ecosystem were pulled in. I did a lot of bug fixes and feature addition and maintenance to this CMS and curation tools that powered the articles. Lot\'s of weird angular goodness. It\'s all gone now though.

This was the first time I used React on a AAA project. It was great; very easy to create components that we could use twofold -- in the frame app and in the embed constructor app. This site was a total success on the technology side, but has not really been picked up from the sales side due to a whole whack a reasons that I\'d rather not relive.

Everything just looks the same on Medium. However, we still wanted to have a a place to publish longform articles with unique layouts and more experimental code options (graphing and mapping with d3, etc.). So, we needed a whole new infrastructure to support this. Hence, longform.timeline.com, which is a little nodejs express app. From getting the hosting with heroku, setting up AWS name servers for the subdomain, setting up heroku pipelines for staging and production and hooking in github and then writing all the styles and javascript for whatever article is in question, I was responsible for it all. Also, I helped come up with features for the article (maps of locations from the article, satanic pentagrams featuring lead characters from the story, etc.) and even contributed to large parts of the design for articles.

No code strucutre, global namespace pollution, very bad standards. I was brought it to basically rebuild the whole dashboard in a sane way. So using Backbone/Marionette and browserify, along with gulp and LESS, I did this following sound MVC principles. The site was a success, but the company was bought by a Chinese company, my webapp was phased out due to the buying companies preference for doing most rendering with PHP. No more single-page webapps. My contract ended early. They offered me a new spot in China, but that was a bit more than I was willing to take on, and I decided to move on to something else here in Vancouver.","images":[{"src":"images/work/11.1.jpg","alt":"QuickMobile Inc Image 1","ratio":"53.75%"},{"src":"images/work/11.2.jpg","alt":"QuickMobile Inc Image 2","ratio":"53.75%"},{"src":"images/work/11.3.jpg","alt":"QuickMobile Inc Image 3","ratio":"53.75%"}]},{"id":10,"title":"QuickMobile Inc.","startdate":"August. 2013","url":"http://www.quickmobile.com/","urltitle":"http://www.quickmobile.com/ (client facing site)","content":"QuickMobile needed a significant overhaul of thier javascript best practices and codebase when I started working fulltime for this Vancouver based shop.

I built my own font using fontstruct\'s site and I launched a number of small websites for displaying it. I had a very rudementary degree of knowledge about web basics before Langara. I\'d done some basic stuff with Wordpress theming and css, but I was pretty green. After Langara, my foundational knowledge was much stronger. The difference between position absolute and relative.
